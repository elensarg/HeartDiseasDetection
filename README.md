# HeartDiseasDetection
Heart disease prediction system using Machine Learning
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a big reason of morbidity and mortality in the current living style. Identification of Cardiovascular disease is an important but a complex task that needs to be performed very minutely, efficiently and the correct automation would be very desirable.
A project that predicts whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.

This project aims to predict heart disease using three different classification methods: 
1.Logistic Regression 
2.Naive Bayes 
3.K-Nearest Neighbours
